### What I'm working on

### Games

I enjoy making games with Go and [Ebitengine](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten). I wrote [a post on making games](https://threedots.tech/post/making-games-in-go/).

At the moment, [airplanes](https://github.com/m110/airplanes) is my most complete open-source game.

I plan to share more of them here.
